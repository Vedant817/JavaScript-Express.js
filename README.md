# Express.js

Welcome to the Express.js Code Samples repository! This collection of code files covers a variety of Express.js topics to help you learn and enhance your skills in building web applications with Express.

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It facilitates the building of web servers and APIs quickly with a simple and intuitive API.

### Key Features of Express.js:

- **Routing:** Easily define routes for handling HTTP requests and mapping them to specific controller functions.

- **Middleware:** Use middleware functions to execute code during the request-response cycle, allowing for additional functionality.

- **Template Engines:** Integrate template engines like EJS or Pug to dynamically generate HTML on the server.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error-handling middleware to manage errors in a centralized way.

- **Static File Serving:** Serve static files (CSS, images, etc.) using built-in middleware.
